# NASA-Weather-Dashboard

## Project Overview
The **NASA Weather Probability Dashboard** is a fully responsive, interactive, and animated web application that allows users to explore historical weather probabilities using NASA Earth observation data. The dashboard provides insights into extreme weather conditions such as “very hot,” “very cold,” “very windy,” or “very wet” for any location and time of year. It is designed to help users plan outdoor activities—like vacations, hikes, or fishing trips—with confidence based on historical weather data.

## Features
- **Location Selection:** Search for a location or drop a pin on an interactive map powered by **Leaflet.js**, with draggable markers and tooltips.
- **Date & Variable Selection:** Select specific days or ranges and choose relevant weather variables like temperature, precipitation, windspeed, air quality, dust concentration, snow, and extreme indices.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Animated charts and graphs using **Chart.js**, **D3.js**, or vanilla JS Canvas to display probability distributions, time series, and bell curves.
- **Dynamic Dashboard:** Real-time summary panel highlighting extreme conditions and probabilities in both textual and graphical formats.
- **Data Export:** Download processed data in CSV or JSON format with metadata, units, and source references.
- **Responsive & Accessible Design:** Fully responsive layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox, with smooth UI animations, collapsible panels, and semantic HTML for accessibility on all devices.
